- I am Rykerg, real name is Ryker.
- I am the offical developer of Anxiety Maths.

- You can search my youtube channel with the search term "Rykerg" and find a discord link from there. If you want to contact me that is.
- My pronouns are he/him but I likely don't care if you refer to me as anything else.
